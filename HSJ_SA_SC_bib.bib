	abstract = {Hydrological models are frequently used for water resources management. One of the most widely used is the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}). However, one weakness of {SWAT} is its simplicity in modeling groundwater, which might affect the representation of hydrological processes. Therefore, modeling strategies that are geared towards achieving more realistic simulations would increase the reliability and credibility of {SWAT} model predictions. In this study, the performance of a {SWAT} model in a geologically heterogeneous basin was optimized by incorporating geological properties through semi-automatic calibration strategies. Based on its geology, the basin was split into four regions, and a default calibration (Scheme I) was compared with three designed calibration schemes: a zonal calibration (Scheme {II}), obtaining a parameter set in each of the regions, a zonal calibration after introducing an impervious layer in an aquifuge region (Scheme {III}), and a final calibration scheme (Scheme {IV}) where an aquifer region was re-calibrated, changing a parameter controlling the required content of water in the aquifer for return flow to increase groundwater flow. The results from the four schemes were evaluated both statistically and by assessing their plausibility to determine which one resulted in the best model performance and the most realistic simulations. All schemes resulted in a satisfactory statistical model performance, but the sequential optimization in the final scheme realistically reproduced the heterogenous hydrological behavior of the geological regions within the basin. To the best of our knowledge, our work addresses this issue for the first time, providing new insights about how to simulate catchments including aquifuge substrates.},

	abstract = {Event-based runoff coefficients can provide information on watershed response. They are useful for catchment comparison to understand how different landscapes “filter” rainfall into eventbased runoff and to explain the observed differences with catchment characteristics and related runoff mechanisms. However, the big drawback of this important parameter is the lack of a standard hydrograph separation method preceding its calculation. Event-based runoff coefficients determined with four well-established separation methods, as well as a newly developed separation method, are compared and are shown to differ considerably. This signifies that runoff coefficients reported in the literature often convey less information than required to allow for catchment classification. The new separation technique (constant-k method) is based on the theory of linear storage. Its advantages are that it is theoretically based in determining the end point of an event and that it can also be applied to events with multiple peaks. Furthermore, it is shown that event-based runoff coefficients in combination with simple statistical models improve our understanding of rainfall–runoff response of catchments with sparse data.},

	abstract = {Sustainable water management should consider climate change effects to ensure its future availability. Hydrological modeling is a supportive tool for this analysis, which has been used in this work to assess the climate change impacts on the water resources of three basins under Mediterranean climate (Ompólveda and Salado River basins, in Spain, and Guadalupe River basin, in Mexico). The outcomes of previous climate change scenarios simulation addressed with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) have been compiled, evaluating the impacts on the water balance, and focusing on the streamflow components. The potential implications of these effects on energy production have been discussed. The results point to a streamflow reduction by the end of the century around 50\%–60\% in the worst scenarios, with varying effects for each of the streamflow components. In the Spanish catchments, where groundwater contribution dominates in baseline conditions, a noticeable decrease of this component is expected (up to -74\%), becoming lateral flow the main streamflow component. In the Mexican basin, lateral flow, which is already predominant (69\%), will experience the largest absolute decrease, but the highest relative decrease might be experienced by groundwater flow, up to -92\%. Absolute variations in the surface component are small and the different ways to simulate the climate change scenarios might hinder their interpretation. This work shows that water resources will be even more scarce in these regions, being especially worrying the groundwater component reduction, which currently maintains the streamflow during dry periods. This situation would limit energy production both from sources that directly use water, such as hydropower, and others that require water for cooling. Higher atmospheric and water temperatures will increase demands for irrigation and for cooling systems. Therefore, competition for water will rise among key sectors, and an accurate planning considering these factors must be a priority.},

	abstract = {{SWAT}+ is a completely restructured version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) that was developed to face present and future challenges in water resources modeling and management and to meet the needs of the worldwide user community. It is expected to improve code development and maintenance; support data availability, analysis, and visualization; and enhance the model's capabilities in terms of the spatial representation of elements and processes within watersheds. The most important change is the implementation of landscape units and flow and pollutant routing across the landscape. Also, {SWAT}+ offers more flexibility than {SWAT} in defining management schedules, routing constituents, and connecting managed flow systems to the natural stream network. To test the basic hydrologic function of {SWAT}+, it was applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed (Georgia) without enhanced overland routing and compared with previous models. {SWAT}+ gave similar results and inaccuracies as these models did for streamflow and water balance. Taking full advantage of the new capabilities of {SWAT}+ regarding watershed discretization and landscape and river interactions is expected to improve simulations in future studies. While many capabilities of {SWAT} have already been enhanced in {SWAT}+ and new capabilities have been added, the model will continue to evolve in response to advancements in scientific knowledge and the demands of the growing worldwide user community.

	title = {{SWAT}: Model use, calibration, and validation},
	abstract = {{SWAT} (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) is a comprehensive, semi-distributed river basin model that requires a large number of input parameters, which complicates model parameterization and calibration. Several calibration techniques have been developed for {SWAT}, including manual calibration procedures and automated procedures using the shuffled complex evolution method and other common methods. In addition, {SWAT}-{CUP} was recently developed and provides a decision-making framework that incorporates a semi-automated approach ({SUFI}2) using both manual and automated calibration and incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In {SWAT}-{CUP}, users can manually adjust parameters and ranges iteratively between autocalibration runs. Parameter sensitivity analysis helps focus the calibration and uncertainty analysis and is used to provide statistics for goodness-of-fit. The user interaction or manual component of the {SWAT}-{CUP} calibration forces the user to obtain a better understanding of the overall hydrologic processes (e.g., baseflow ratios, {ET}, sediment sources and sinks, crop yields, and nutrient balances) and of parameter sensitivity. It is important for future calibration developments to spatially account for hydrologic processes; improve model run time efficiency; include the impact of uncertainty in the conceptual model, model parameters, and measured variables used in calibration; and assist users in checking for model errors. When calibrating a physically based model like {SWAT}, it is important to remember that all model input parameters must be kept within a realistic uncertainty range and that no automatic procedure can substitute for actual physical knowledge of the watershed.},

For a concise model evaluation, the different phases of the hydrograph have to be considered in multi-metric frameworks with appropriate performance metrics. Low and high flows need to be reproduced simultaneously without neglecting the other phases of the hydrograph. In this paper, we highlight the relevance of very low and low flows with separate performance metrics. We present a multi-metric evaluation framework to identify calibration runs, which represent the different phases of the hydrograph precisely. A stepwise evaluation was done with commonly used statistical performance metrics (Nash–Sutcliffe, percent bias) and signature metrics, which are based on the flow duration curve ({FDC}). In order to consider a fairly balanced evaluation between high and low flow phases, we divided the flow duration curve into segments of high, medium and low flow phases, and additionally into very high and very low flow phases. The model performance in these segments was evaluated separately with the root mean square error ({RMSE}). Our results show that this evaluation method leads to an improved selection of good calibration runs to enhance the overall model performance by the refined segmentation of {FDC}. By combining performance metrics for high flow conditions with low flow conditions, this study demonstrates the challenge of calibrating a model with a satisfactory performance in high and low phases simultaneously. Consequently, we conclude that an additional performance metric for very low flows should be included in model analyzes to improve the overall performance in all phases of the hydrograph.},

Here I suggest several promising directions forward, including (1) designing new data networks, field observations, and field experiments, with explicit recognition of the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of hydrologic processes, (2) replacing linear, additive “black box” models with “gray box” approaches that better capture the nonlinear and non-additive character of hydrologic systems, (3) developing physically based governing equations for hydrologic behavior at the catchment or hillslope scale, recognizing that they may look different from the equations that describe the small-scale physics, (4) developing models that are minimally parameterized and therefore stand some chance of failing the tests that they are subjected to, and (5) developing ways to test models more comprehensively and incisively. I argue that scientific progress will mostly be achieved through the collision of theory and data, rather than through increasingly elaborate and parameter-rich models that may succeed as mathematical marionettes, dancing to match the calibration data even if their underlying premises are unrealistic. Thus advancing the science of hydrology will require not only developing theories that get the right answers but also testing whether they get the right answers for the right reasons.},

Consequently, rating metrics can mathematically validate model results as satisfactory even when some of the simulated hydrologic processes are incorrectly represented during the calibration process. In this paper, we argue that to properly represent the hydrologic system, calibration tasks focused on modifying model parameters should account for equifinality, model inadequacy, and constraint inadequacy. To demonstrate our argument, we conducted a traditional calibration using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) coupled to the Modular Finite-difference Flow Model ({MODFLOW}) to simulate the hydrologic processes in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watershed ({FCREW}) in central western Oklahoma. The results indicated that model calibration based on metrics from a single domain, in this case using {SWAT}, did not necessarily guarantee an appropriate representation of water circulation. Moreover, unsupervised calibration techniques based on the objective-function optimization (e.g., inverse calibration using {SWAT}-{CUP} {SUFI}2 algorithm) may not be sufficient if model constraints in multiple domains are not properly set, resulting in distorted parameters. This practice can result in the misrepresentation of water circulation and can have adverse impacts on environmental model results used to support policies and decisions.},

The Tagus-Segura aqueduct ({TSA}) is a large and strategic water transfer scheme in Spain that connects Entrepeñas and Buendía reservoirs in the Tagus river headwaters to the Segura river basin, a highly stressed Mediterranean area.
Study focus
The operating rules of the {TSA} underwent several modifications over the years, and the debate about which are the optimal parameters to meet the interests of the parties involved is still open. We employed Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search to jointly optimize the re-operation of the headwaters dams and the water transfer policy with respect to four conflicting objectives: Tagus and Segura water demands, hydropower production and socioeconomic benefit of the population living on the shores of the headwaters reservoirs. We tested the optimization under the baseline and the 2027 scenario, which foresees an increased environmental flow ({EF}) in the Tagus river.

The proposed operating rule presents optimized control parameters, a higher degree of freedom and a transferred volume that cyclically varies according to the hydrological stage of the year. In the 2027 scenario, despite the increased {EF}, the deficit in the aqueduct shows a limited increase compared to the historical solution (+10\%), while the storage deficit is strongly reduced (−73\%). This benefits the population living on the reservoirs shores and also ensures more stability to the aqueduct functioning.},

	abstract = {Conventional water management strategies, that serve solely socio-economic demands and neglect changing natural conditions of the river basins, face significant challenges in governing complex human-hydrological systems, especially in the areas with constrained water availability. In this study we assess the possibility to harmonize the inter-sectoral water allocation scheme within a highly altered human-hydrological system under reduction in water availability, triggered by projected climate change applying scenario-based approach. The Tagus River Basin headwaters, with significant disproportion in the water resources allocation between the environmental and socio-economic targets were taken as a perfect example of such system out of balance. We propose three different water allocation strategies for this region, including two conventional schemes and one imposing shift to sustainable water management and environmental restoration of the river. We combine in one integrated modelling framework the eco-hydrological process-based Soil and Water Integrated Model ({SWIM}), coupled with the conceptual reservoir and water allocation modules driven by the latest bias-corrected climate projections for the region and investigate possible water allocation scenarios in the region under constrained water availability in the future. Our results show that the socio-economic demands have to be re-considered and lowered under any water allocation strategy, as the climate impacts may significantly reduce water availability in the future. Further, we show that a shift to sustainable water management strategy and river restoration is possible even under reduced water availability. Finally, our results suggest that the adaptation of complex human-hydrological systems to climate change and a shift to a more sustainable water management are likely to be parts of one joint strategy to cope with climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {The latest version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}+) features several improvements compared with previous versions of the model, for example, the definition of landscape units that allow for a better representation of spatio-temporal dynamics. To evaluate the new model capabilities in lowland catchments characterized by near-surface groundwater tables and extensive tile drainage, we assess the performance of two {SWAT}+ model setups in comparison to a setup based on a previous {SWAT} model version ({SWAT}3S with a modified three groundwater storage model) in the Kielstau catchment in Northern Germany. The Kielstau catchment has an area of about 50 km2, is dominated by agricultural land use, and has been thoroughly monitored since 2005. In both {SWAT}+ setups, the catchment is divided into upland areas and floodplains, but in the first {SWAT}+ model setup, runoff from the hydrologic response units is summed up at landscape unit level and added directly to the stream. In the second {SWAT}+ model setup, runoff is routed across the landscape before it reaches the streams. Model results are compared with regard to (i) model performance for stream flow at the outlet of the catchment and (ii) aggregated as well as temporally and spatially distributed water balance components. All three model setups show a very good performance at the catchment outlet. In comparison to a previous version of the {SWAT} model that produced more groundwater flow, the {SWAT}+ model produced more tile drainage flow and surface runoff. Results from the new {SWAT}+ model confirm that the representation of routing processes from uplands to floodplains in the model further improved the representation of hydrological processes. Particularly, the stronger spatial heterogeneity that can be related to characteristics of the landscape, is very promising for a better understanding and model representation of hydrological fluxes in lowland areas. The outcomes of this study are expected to further prove the applicability of {SWAT}+ and provide useful information for future model development.},

High sediment and nutrient yields without retention control result in environmental deterioration of surrounding areas. In the present study, the soil and water assessment tool ({SWAT}) model was developed for El Beal watershed, an anthropogenic and ungauged basin located in the southeast of Spain that drains into a coastal lagoon of high environmental value. The effectiveness of five {BMPs} (contour planting, filter strips, reforestation, fertilizer application and check dam restoration) was quantified, both individually and in combination, to test their impact on sediment and nutrient reduction. For calibration and validation processes, actual evapotranspiration ({AET}) data obtained from a remote sensing dataset called Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model ({GLEAM}) were used. The {SWAT} model achieved good performance in the calibration period, with statistical values of 0.78 for Kling–Gupta efficiency ({KGE}), 0.81 for coefficient of determination (R2), 0.58 for Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}) and 3.9\% for percent bias ({PBIAS}), as well as in the validation period ({KGE} = 0.67, R2 = 0.83, {NS} = 0.53 and {PBIAS} = −25.3\%). The results show that check dam restoration is the most effective {BMP} with a reduction of 90\% in sediment yield (S), 15\% in total nitrogen ({TN}) and 22\% in total phosphorus ({TP}) at the watershed scale, followed by reforestation (S = 27\%, {TN} = 16\% and {TP} = 20\%). All effectiveness values improved when {BMPs} were assessed in combination. The outcome of this study could provide guidance for decision makers in developing possible solutions for environmental problems in a coastal lagoon.},

The primary purpose of the {SVI} is to aid conservation planners in more rapidly assessing managed lands and inherent resource concerns. The index is based on hydrologic soil group, slope, and soil erodibility for cultivated cropland soils, with the addition of percentage rock fragments and organic matter when considering leaching. Although the {SVI} is intended for use throughout the United States, its development was based on the physiographic and rainfall characteristics of the Upper Mississippi and Ohio-Tennessee River basins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the {SVI} in areas both in and outside of the area for which it was developed. Thirteen different watersheds were selected to conduct this evaluation. Vulnerability classifications using the {SVI} were compared with those from on-site experts' knowledge and with model simulations using local data. Four companion papers in this special collection discuss {SVI} classification based on the effects of land slope, artificial drainage, sediment and nutrient loads, and vulnerability assessment using hydrologic simulation models. Using results from the various sites, the objective of this paper was to synthesize the interpretation of the value and applicability of {SVI} vulnerability classification to sediment and nutrient loss across various physiographic regions and suggest where improvement in the {SVI} could be made.},

	abstract = {Resolution of data is a sensitive issue in environmental modeling. Professionals from diverse background use Geographic Information Systems ({GIS}) for environmental modeling. Availability of {GIS} software and publicly available digital data make modeling more accessible to anyone, but without proper understanding of the resampling and resolution of the digital database, model results are of little practical significance. It is imperative that the government agencies and their contractors responsible for using {GIS}-based modeling to implement regulatory goals must have strong foundational knowledge of resolution of data and their implications. This study utilizes the {SWAT} (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model integrated with {ArcView} to examine how sensitive the {SWAT} model was to the resolution of Digital Elevation Models ({DEMs}) while predicting the streamflow. This research uses a case study to demonstrate to the modeling community that resolution of data matters when predicting flow. If there were no effect of resolution on the modeled results then the original 90 m {DEM} and the original 30 m {DEM} resampled to 90 m would show similar trends. Initial input layers into {SWAT} were: {DEMs}, soils, landuse ({LU}) and meteorological data. The model-predicted streamflow was validated against {USGS} ({US} Geological Survey) stream gauge data. {DEMs} are available at 30, 90 and 300 m resolution originally; therefore, this study analysed the sensitivity of the predicted streamflow at 30, 90 and 300 m resolution. Results indicated that {SWAT} is indeed sensitive to the resolution of the {DEMs}: original 90 and 30 m {DEM} resampled to 90 m did not show the same trend. Therefore, the effects of resolution cannot be ignored and resampling may not be adequate in modeling stream flows using a distributed watershed model. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Watershed-scale hydrological models have become important tools to understand, assess, and predict the impacts of natural and anthropogenic-driven activities on water resources. However, model predictions are associated with uncertainties stemming from sources such as model input data. As an important input to most watershed models, land use/cover ({LULC}) data can affect hydrological predictions and influence the interpretation of modeling results. In addition, it has been shown that the use of soft data will further ensure the quality of modeling results to be closer to watershed behavior. In this study, the ecologically relevant flows ({ERFs}) are the primary soft data to be considered as a part of the modeling processes. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of {LULC} input data on the hydrological responses of the rapidly urbanizing Upper Cahaba River watershed ({UCRW}) located in Alabama, {USA}. Two sources of {LULC} data, i.e., National Land Cover Database ({NLCD}) and Digitized Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper ({TM}) images, were used as input in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) model for the years 1992 and 2011 using meteorological data from 1988 to 2013. The model was calibrated at the watershed outlet against daily streamflow from 1988 to 1993 using the 1992 {LULC} data and validated for the 2008–2013 period using the 2011 {LULC} datasets. The results show that the models achieved similar performances with both {LULC} datasets during the calibration and validation periods according to commonly used statistical rating metrics such as Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ({NSE}), coefficient of determination (R2), and model percent bias ({PBIAS}). However, {LULC} input information had substantial impacts on simulated {ERFs} such as mean monthly streamflow, maximum and minimum flows of different durations, and low flow regimes. This study demonstrates that watershed models based on different sources of {LULC} and applied under different {LULC} temporal conditions can achieve equally good performances in predicting streamflow. However, substantial differences might exist in predicted hydrological regimes and {ERF} metrics depending on the sources of {LULC} data and the {LULC} year considered. Our results reveal that {LULC} data can significantly impact the simulated flow regimes of the {UCRW} with underlaying influences on the predicted biotic and abiotic structures of aquatic and riparian habitats.},

The land use quality impact was studied with a low-resolution global dataset ({ESA}-{CCI} with a 300-m resolution) and a refined dataset classified based on Sentinel-2 satellite images (20-m resolution). Two models were successfully built under {ArcSWAT}, and {SWAT}-{CUP} software, which were calibrated and validated after sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The measured precipitation in the Bine El Ouidane dam watershed was used for model calibration and validation. Snowmelt parameters were first calibrated before analyzing the sensitivity of flow parameters and calibrating the most sensitive ones. The performance of the calibration and validation was very satisfactory for both models based on statistical coefficients and graphical evaluation in addition to parameter uncertainty of the 95 {PPU} band. The results revealed slightly higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, root mean square error and R2 values for the {SWAT}-{CCI} model than those for the {SWAT}-Sentinel-2 model (in calibration, {NSE} was approximately 0.85 for the first model and 0.76 for the second model, whereas in validation, {NSE} was 0.70 and 0.61, respectively). This study demonstrated that the streamflow assessment accuracy obtained with the {SWAT} model was not enhanced when applying finer-spatial resolution land use data and that the accuracy was not directly related to the increase in the number of delineated hydrological response units ({HRUs}).},

Higher resolution data can accurately describe watershed characteristics but can be computationally intensive. Therefore, it becomes important to select a data resolution, which aides in model running efficiency by not compromising with model accuracy.

	abstract = {Land-use/land-cover ({LULC}) data represent important inputs in hydrologic models. The {LULC} data can affect modelled watershed hydrologic processes by altering the rates of interception, inﬁltration, evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge that govern the timing and volume of surface and river runoff. A thorough understanding of the impacts of {LULC} resolution on hydrologic modelling is thus essential and important. Generally, differences in the resolution of {LULC} data in hydrologic modelling can result in different interpretation accuracies, {LULC} classifications and spatial resolutions for one-year {LULC} datasets; typically, such models only use one-year {LULC} datasets in the simulation period to simply the calculation process. But how would the model performance change if multiple years of {LULC} data were input into hydrologic models? To better understand the impacts of {LULC} resolution on hydrologic modelling, this study input four {LULC} datasets into the {SWAT} (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model and compared the impacts of the {LULC} datasets on the hydrologic modelling results for a high-elevation, cold and mountainous watershed in Northwest China. The first three datasets describe the {LULC} in the year 2000 and are based on different interpretation accuracies, {LULC} classifications and spatial resolutions. The last dataset is the yearly {LULC} data over a 20-year period. To incorporate the yearly {LULC} dataset, we modified the {HRU} (hydrologic response unit) division method and {SWAT} computational structure. The main findings were as follows. (1) A yearly {LULC} dataset may result in a higher simulation complexity in the {SWAT} model because this involves the most {LULC} patches. (2) If multiple years of {LULC} data exist, a {LULC} dataset with smaller time intervals, e.g. yearly is necessary in streamflow modelling in {SWAT} to get better model performance, the model performance may improve by 2.2\%–13.9\% compared to one-year {LULC} datasets. (3) If only one-year {LULC} datasets exist, we suggest inputting a dataset with a high resolution and remote sensing interpretation accuracy and reduced numbers of {LULC} classification types into {SWAT} to improve the hydrologic model performance; with such an approach, the model performance may improve by 1.1\%–6.9\% compared to other one-year {LULC} datasets.},

	abstract = {Many researchers have examined the impact of detailed soil spatial information on hydrological modelling due to the fact that such information serves as important input to hydrological modelling, yet is difficult and expensive to obtain. Most research has focused on the effects at single scales; however, the effects in the context of spatial aggregation across different scales are largely missing. This paper examines such effects by comparing the simulated runoffs across scales from watershed models based on two different levels of soil spatial information: the 10-m-resolution soil data derived from the Soil-Land Inference Model ({SoLIM}) and the 1:24000 scale Soil Survey Geographic ({SSURGO}) database in the United States. The study was conducted at three different spatial scales: two at different watershed size levels (referred to as full watershed and sub-basin, respectively) and one at the model minimum simulation unit level. A fully distributed hydrologic model ({WetSpa}) and a semi-distributed model ({SWAT}) were used to assess the effects. The results show that at the minimum simulation unit level the differences in simulated runoff are large, but the differences gradually decrease as the spatial scale of the simulation units increases. For sub-basins larger than 10 km2 in the study area, stream flows simulated by spatially detailed {SoLIM} soil data do not significantly vary from those by {SSURGO}. The effects of spatial scale are shown to correlate with aggregation effect of the watershed routing process. The unique findings of this paper provide an important and unified perspective on the different views reported in the literature concerning how spatial detail of soil data affects watershed modelling. Different views result from different scales at which those studies were conducted. In addition, the findings offer a potentially useful basis for selecting details of soil spatial information appropriate for watershed modelling at a given scale.

	abstract = {Decision tables have been used for many years in data processing and business applications to simulate complex rule sets. Several computer languages have been developed based on rule systems and they are easily programmed in several current languages. Land management and river–reservoir models simulate complex land management operations and reservoir management in highly regulated river systems. Decision tables are a precise yet compact way to model the rule sets and corresponding actions found in these models. In this study, we discuss the suitability of decision tables to simulate management in the river basin scale Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}+) model. Decision tables are developed to simulate automated irrigation and reservoir releases. A simple auto irrigation application of decision tables was developed using plant water stress as a condition for irrigating corn in Texas. Sensitivity of the water stress trigger and irrigation application amounts were shown on soil moisture and corn yields. In addition, the Grapevine Reservoir near Dallas, Texas was used to illustrate the use of decision tables to simulate reservoir releases. The releases were conditioned on reservoir volumes and flood season. The release rules as implemented by the decision table realistically simulated flood releases as evidenced by a daily Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency ({NSE}) of 0.52 and a percent bias of −1.1\%. Using decision tables to simulate management in land, river, and reservoir models was shown to have several advantages over current approaches, including: (1) mature technology with considerable literature and applications; (2) ability to accurately represent complex, real world decision-making; (3) code that is efficient, modular, and easy to maintain; and (4) tables that are easy to maintain, support, and modify.},

	abstract = {The prediction accuracy of agricultural nonpoint source pollution models such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) depends on how well model input spatial parameters describe the characteristics of the watershed. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of different soil data resolutions on stream flow, sediment and nutrient predictions when used as input for {SWAT}. {SWAT} model predictions were compared for the two {US} Department of Agriculture soil databases with different resolution, namely the State Soil Geographic database ({STATSGO}) and the Soil Survey Geographic database ({SSURGO}). Same number of sub-basins was used in the watershed delineation. However, the number of {HRUs} generated when {STATSGO} and {SSURGO} soil data were used is 261 and 1301, respectively. {SSURGO}, with the highest spatial resolution, has 51 unique soil types in the watershed distributed in 1301 {HRUs}, while {STATSGO} has only three distributed in 261 {HRUS}. As a result of low resolution {STATSGO} assigns a single classification to areas that may have different soil types if {SSURGO} were used. {SSURGO} included Hydrologic Response Units ({HRUs}) with soil types that were generalized to one soil group in {STATSGO}. The difference in the number and size of {HRUs} also has an effect on sediment yield parameters (slope and slope length). Thus, as a result of the discrepancies in soil type and size of {HRUs} stream flow predicted was higher when {SSURGO} was used compared to {STATSGO}. {SSURGO} predicted less stream loading than {STATSGO} in terms of sediment and sediment-attached nutrients components, and vice versa for dissolved nutrients. When compared to mean daily measured flow, {STATSGO} performed better relative to {SSURGO} before calibration. {SSURGO} provided better results after calibration as evaluated by R2 value (0.74 compared to 0.61 for {STATSGO}) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of Efficiency ({NSE}) values (0.70 and 0.61 for {SSURGO} and {STATSGO}, respectively) although both are in the same satisfactory range. Modelers need to weigh the benefits before selecting the type of data resolution they are going to use depending on the watershed size and level of accuracy required because more effort is required to prepare and calibrate the model when a fine resolution soil data is used.},

Several datasets are compared: ground-based weather stations, the 8-km {SAFRAN} product (Système d’Analyse Fournissant des Renseignements Adaptés à la Nivologie), the 0.5° {CFSR} product (Climate Forecasting System Reanalysis) and several derived {SAFRAN} grids upscaled to 16, 32, 64 and 128 km. The {SWAT} model, calibrated on weather stations, was successively run with each gridded weather dataset. Performances with {SAFRAN} up to 64 or 128 km were poor, due to a contraction of the spatial variance of daily precipitation. Performances with 8-km {SAFRAN} are similar to that of the aggregated 16- and 32-km {SAFRAN} grids. The {\textasciitilde}30-km {CFSR} product was found to perform well at some sites, while in others, its performance was considerably inferior because of grid points where precipitation was overestimated. The same problem was found in the calibration, where data at some weather stations did not appear to be representative of the subwatershed in which they are used to compute hydrology. These results suggest that the difference in the representation of the climate was more influential than its spatial resolution, an analysis that was confirmed by similar performances obtained with the {SWAT} model calibrated on the 16- and 32-km {SAFRAN} grids. However, the better performances obtained from these two weather datasets than from the ground-based stations’ dataset confirmed the advantage of using the {SAFRAN} product in {SWAT} modelling.},

	abstract = {Watershed scale models simulating hydrological and water quality processes have advanced rapidly in sophistication, process representation, flexibility in model structure, and input data. With calibration being an inevitable step prior to any model application, there is need for a simple procedure to assess whether or not a parameter should be adjusted for calibration. We provide a rationale for a hierarchical selection of parameters to adjust during calibration and recommend that modelers progress from parameters that are most uncertain to parameters that are least uncertain, namely starting with pure calibration parameters, followed by derived parameters, and finally measured parameters. We show that different information contained in time and frequency domains can provide useful insight regarding the selection of parameters to adjust in calibration. For example, wavelet coherence analysis shows time periods and scales where a particular parameter is sensitive. The second component of the paper discusses model performance evaluation measures. Given the importance of these models to support decision-making for a wide range of environmental issues, the hydrology community is compelled to improve the metrics used to evaluate model performance. More targeted and comprehensive metrics will facilitate better and more efficient calibration and will help demonstrate that the model is useful for the intended purpose. Here, we introduce a suite of new tools for model evaluation, packaged as an open-source Hydrologic Model Evaluation ({HydroME}) Toolbox. We apply these tools in the calibration and evaluation of Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) models of two watersheds, the Le Sueur River Basin (2880 km2) and Root River Basin (4300 km2) in southern Minnesota, {USA}.},

	abstract = {Watershed models typically are evaluated solely through comparison of in-stream water and nutrient fluxes with measured data using established performance criteria, whereas processes and responses within the interior of the watershed that govern these global fluxes often are neglected. Due to the large number of parameters at the disposal of these models, circumstances may arise in which excellent global results are achieved using inaccurate magnitudes of these “intra-watershed” responses. When used for scenario analysis, a given model hence may inaccurately predict the global, in-stream effect of implementing land-use practices at the interior of the watershed. In this study, data regarding internal watershed behavior are used to constrain parameter estimation to maintain realistic intra-watershed responses while also matching available in-stream monitoring data. The methodology is demonstrated for the Eagle Creek Watershed in central Indiana. Streamflow and nitrate ({NO}3) loading are used as global in-stream comparisons, with two process responses, the annual mass of denitrification and the ratio of {NO}3 losses from subsurface and surface flow, used to constrain parameter estimation. Results show that imposing these constraints not only yields realistic internal watershed behavior but also provides good in-stream comparisons. Results further demonstrate that in the absence of incorporating intra-watershed constraints, evaluation of nutrient abatement strategies could be misleading, even though typical performance criteria are satisfied. Incorporating intra-watershed responses yields a watershed model that more accurately represents the observed behavior of the system and hence a tool that can be used with confidence in scenario evaluation.},

	abstract = {Approaches to modeling the continuous hydrologic response of ungauged basins use observable physical characteristics of watersheds to either directly infer values for the parameters of hydrologic models, or to establish regression relationships between watershed structure and model parameters. Both these approaches still have widely discussed limitations, including impacts of model structural uncertainty. In this paper we introduce an alternative, model independent, approach to streamflow prediction in ungauged basins based on empirical evidence of relationships between watershed structure, climate and watershed response behavior. Instead of directly estimating values for model parameters, different hydrologic response behaviors of the watershed, quantified through model independent streamflow indices, are estimated and subsequently regionalized in an uncertainty framework. This results in expected ranges of streamflow indices in ungauged watersheds. A pilot study using 30 {UK} watersheds shows how this regionalized information can be used to constrain ensemble predictions of any model at ungauged sites. Dominant controlling characteristics were found to be climate (wetness index), watershed topography (slope), and hydrogeology. Main streamflow indices were high pulse count, runoff ratio, and the slope of the flow duration curve. This new approach provided sharp and reliable predictions of continuous streamflow at the ungauged sites tested.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a calibration framework based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation ({GLUE}) that can be used to condition hydrological model parameter distributions in scarcely gauged river basins, where data is uncertain, intermittent or nonconcomitant. At the heart of this framework is the conditioning of the model parameters such as to reproduce key signatures of the observed data within some limits of acceptability. These signatures are either based on hard or on soft information. Hard information signatures are defined as signatures for which the limits of acceptability may be objectively derived from the distribution of long series of observed values, and which effectively constrain the model parameters. Soft signatures are less effective in parameter conditioning or their limits of acceptability cannot be objectively derived. During random parameter sampling, parameter sets are accepted as equally likely if they meet all the hard limits of acceptability. This results in an intermediate parameter distribution, which can be used to reduce the sampling limits. Then, the soft information may be introduced in a second constraining step to reach a final parameter distribution. The modeler can use the final results as a guideline for a further search for information, possibly from new observations yet to collect. In an application of the framework to the Luangwa catchment in Zambia, three information signatures are retrieved from a data set of old discharge time series and used to condition the parameters of a daily conceptual rainfall-runoff model. We performed two independent calibration experiments with two significantly different satellite rainfall estimates as model input. The results show consistent parameter distributions and considerable reduction of the prior parameter space and corresponding output realizations. These results illustrate the potential of the proposed calibration framework for predictions in scarcely gauged catchments.},

	abstract = {Climate change ({CC}) has a high impact on hydrological processes which calls for reliable projections of {CC} hydrological impacts at large scales. However, there are several challenges in hydrological modelling at large scales. Large-scale models are often not adapted and evaluated at regional scale due to high computation time requirements or lack of information on human interactions, such as dam operations and irrigation practices at local scale. In this study, we present a regionalised methodology that uses a hydrological mass balance calibration ({HMBC}) and global datasets to represent reservoir and irrigation practices and apply these to a {SWAT}+ model for Southern Africa. We evaluate the influence of {HMBC} and the representation on irrigation and reservoirs on model performance and climate projections. We propose a generalised implementation of reservoirs using global datasets and decision tables to represent irrigation and reservoir management. Results show that inclusion of irrigation, reservoirs and {HMBC} leads to improved simulation of discharge and evapotranspiration with fewer iterations than a full parameter calibration. There is a substantial difference between projections made by the regionalised model and default model when looking at local impacts. We conclude that large-scale hydrological studies that involve local analysis and spatial mapping of results benefit from {HMBC} and representation of management practices. The proposed methodology can be scaled up and improve overall projections made by global models.},

	abstract = {Drainage outflow from artificial subsurface drains can be a significant contributor to watershed water yield in many humid regions of the world. Although many studies have undertaken to simulate hydrologic processes in drained watersheds, there is a need for a study that first, uses physically based spatially distributed modeling for both surface and subsurface processes; and second, quantifies the effect of surface and subsurface parameters on watershed drainage outflow. This study presents a modified version of the {SWAT}+ watershed model to address these objectives. The {SWAT}+ model includes the gwflow module, a new spatially distributed groundwater routine for calculating groundwater storage, groundwater head, and groundwater fluxes throughout the watershed using a grid cell approach, modified in this study to simulate the removal of groundwater by subsurface drains. The modeling approach is applied to the South Fork Watershed (583 km2), located in Iowa, {USA}, where most fields are drained artificially. The model is tested against measured streamflow, groundwater head at monitoring wells, and drainage outflow from a monitored subbasin. Sensitivity analysis is then applied to determine the land surface, subsurface, and drainage parameters that control subsurface drainage. Simulated drainage flow fractions (fraction of streamflow that originates from subsurface drainage) range from 0.37 to 0.54 during 2001–2012, with lower fractions occurring during years of high rainfall due to the increased volumes of surface runoff. Subsurface drainage comprises the vast majority of baseflow. Results indicate surface runoff and soil percolation parameters have the strongest effect on watershed-wide subsurface drainage rather than aquifer and drain properties, pointing to a holistic watershed approach to manage subsurface drainage. The modeling code presented herein can be used to simulate significant hydrologic fluxes in artificially drained watersheds worldwide.},

The advantages and disadvantages are also discussed and summarized. An application framework and the typical practical steps involved in {SA} for hydrological modeling are outlined.

	abstract = {Parameter optimization is an essential step in hydrological simulations, especially for solving practical problems. However, parameter optimization is usually intractable for complex models with a large number of parameters. In this study, a parameter optimization system based on Sensitive Parameter Combinations ({SPCs}) was developed, which comprised four parameter sensitivity analysis ({SA}) methods and a sensitive parameter optimization method. In particular, parameter {SA} was used to screen out the relatively sensitive parameters with significant impacts on the model output, and instead of using All Parameter Combinations ({APCs}), the {SPCs} were optimized with a global optimization method. This system was applied to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) model for daily streamflow simulation and monthly evaluation in four watersheds of China. The results showed that no more than 10 sensitive parameters were identified from 27 adjustable parameters for each watershed. In particular, four parameters ({CN}2, {SOL}\_K, {ALPHA}\_BNK, and {SLSUBBSN}) were relatively sensitive in all watersheds. Compared with optimizing {APCs}, despite the number of parameters was reduced by almost 2/3 in the optimization of {SPCs}, the accuracy was still very close (the maximum Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient ({NSE}) difference was 0.024 and the minimum difference was 0.002) and the optimization speed was doubled. In the comparison of monthly streamflow optimization, the {SPCs} were in good agreement with the {APCs} and had an obvious improvement for the default simulation. The {NSE} values of the {SPCs} optimization were greater than 0.88 during the calibration period in all watersheds and greater than 0.83 during the validation period in three watersheds. These findings indicate that optimizing the sensitivity parameters can greatly reduce the computational costs of {SWAT} streamflow simulations while ensuring their accuracy.},

	abstract = {Watershed models are used worldwide to assist with water and nutrient management under conditions of changing climate, land use, and population. Of these models, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) and {SWAT}+ are the most widely used, although their performance in groundwater-driven watersheds can sometimes be poor due to a simplistic representation of groundwater processes. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new physically-based spatially-distributed groundwater flow module called gwflow for the {SWAT}+ watershed model. The module is embedded in the {SWAT}+ modeling code and is intended to replace the current {SWAT}+ aquifer module. The model accounts for recharge from {SWAT}+ Hydrologic Response Units ({HRUs}), lateral flow within the aquifer, Evapotranspiration ({ET}) from shallow groundwater, groundwater pumping, groundwater–surface water interactions through the streambed, and saturation excess flow. Groundwater head and groundwater storage are solved throughout the watershed domain using a water balance equation for each grid cell. The modified {SWAT}+ modeling code is applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed ({LREW}) (327 km2) in southern Georgia, {USA} for demonstration purposes. Using the gwflow module for the {LREW} increased run-time by 20\% compared to the original {SWAT}+ modeling code. Results from an uncalibrated model are compared against streamflow discharge and groundwater head time series. Although further calibration is required if the {LREW} model is to be used for scenario analysis, results highlight the capabilities of the new {SWAT}+ code to simulate both land surface and subsurface hydrological processes and represent the watershed-wide water balance. Using the modified {SWAT}+ model can provide physically realistic groundwater flow gradients, fluxes, and interactions with streams for modeling studies that assess water supply and conservation practices. This paper also serves as a tutorial on modeling groundwater flow for general watershed modelers.},

	abstract = {{SWAT}+ is a fundamentally restructured version of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. The new model structure affects the functional relationship between some of the simulated processes and their associated model parameters. This study provides an overview of process-parameter relationships based on a multi-site analysis. Within the framework of a cooperation of scientists working with the {SWAT} model in Germany ({SWAT}-{DE}), {SWAT}+ was applied to seven catchments, located in different climatic and topographic regions in Germany.  We investigated the functional relationships between {SWAT}+ model parameters and different simulated water balance components.

We employed {SWAT}+ revision 60.5.3 to simulate snowfall processes, evapotranspiration, the surface and lateral runoff components including tile drainage flow, and groundwater related processes at the daily time temporal resolution for all catchments. A selection of 22 {SWAT}+ model parameters relevant for the simulation of the water cycle were sampled with a Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test ({FAST}) sampling design and subsequently input into the {SWAT}+ simulations. {FAST} sensitivity indices were calculated for each time step of the simulated water balance components. The daily {FAST} sensitivities were summarized for each process-parameter relationship for each catchment . We identified sensitivity patterns that were found to be common between catchments. Other process-parameter relationships were exclusively relevant in individual catchments. The analysis determined several functional parameter groups that can be exclusively associated with a specific hydrological process. In contrast, parameters such as perc or awc were found to be dominant across multiple processes. The findings derived from this study support a more process-based and systematic {SWAT}+ model calibration.},

Given a mathematical or computational model y=f(x1,x2,…,xk), where the input factors xi's are uncorrelated with one another, one can see y as the realization of a stochastic process obtained by sampling each of the xi from its marginal distribution. The sensitivity indices are related to the decomposition of the variance of y into terms either due to each xi taken singularly (first order indices), as well as into terms due to the cooperative effects of more than one xi. In this paper we assume that one has computed the full set of first order sensitivity indices as well as the full set of total-order sensitivity indices (a fairly common strategy in sensitivity analysis), and show that in this case the same set of model evaluations can be used to compute double estimates of: \&\#x02022;the total effect of two factors taken together, for all such k2 couples, where k is the dimensionality of the model;\&\#x02022;the total effect of k−2 factors taken together, for all k2 such (k−2) ples. We further introduce a new strategy for the computation of the full sets of first plus total order sensitivity indices that is about 50\% cheaper in terms of model evaluations with respect to previously published works. We discuss separately the case where the input factors xi's are not independent from each other.},

Study focus
Weather data are the key drivers of hydrological modelling. However, available weather data can present gaps in data sequences and are often limited in their spatial coverage for use in such hydrological models as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}). To overcome this limitation, {SWAT} includes a weather generator algorithm that can complete this data based on long-term weather statistics. This work presents a newly developed weather statistics dataset for Peninsular Spain ({PSWG}), calculated from national gridded datasets according to the {SWAT} model format. {PSWG} provides a higher resolution that stands as a compelling alternative to the statistics calculated from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis ({CFSR}) that are available on the {SWAT} website.
New hydrological insights for the region
The dataset has been evaluated using {PSWG} and {CFSR} datasets for different data availability scenarios to reconstruct weather series in three watersheds with contrasting weather climates. Results underscore the superiority of the {PSWG} dataset in reconstructing missing data for hydrological simulations. This approach provides a strong alternative for {SWAT} applications in Peninsular Spain and the applied methodology can be replicated in other countries that dispose of high-resolution gridded rainfall and temperature datasets.},

	shorttitle = {Global Sensitivity Analysis},
	abstract = {Complex mathematical and computational models are used in all areas of society and technology and yet model based science is increasingly contested or refuted, especially when models are applied to controversial themes in domains such as health, the environment or the economy. More stringent standards of proofs are demanded from model-based numbers, especially when these numbers represent potential financial losses, threats to human health or the state of the environment. Quantitative sensitivity analysis is generally agreed to be one such standard. Mathematical models are good at mapping assumptions into inferences. A modeller makes assumptions about laws pertaining to the system, about its status and a plethora of other, often arcane, system variables and internal model settings. To what extent can we rely on the model-based inference when most of these assumptions are fraught with uncertainties? Global Sensitivity Analysis offers an accessible treatment of such problems via quantitative sensitivity analysis, beginning with the first principles and guiding the reader through the full range of recommended practices with a rich set of solved exercises. The text explains the motivation for sensitivity analysis, reviews the required statistical concepts, and provides a guide to potential applications. The book:  Provides a self-contained treatment of the subject, allowing readers to learn and practice global sensitivity analysis without further materials.   Presents ways to frame the analysis, interpret its results, and avoid potential pitfalls.   Features numerous exercises and solved problems to help illustrate the applications.   Is authored by leading sensitivity analysis practitioners, combining a range of disciplinary backgrounds.  Postgraduate students and practitioners in a wide range of subjects, including statistics, mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry, environmental sciences, biology, toxicology, actuarial sciences, and econometrics will find much of use here. This book will prove equally valuable to engineers working on risk analysis and to financial analysts concerned with pricing and hedging.},

	abstract = {The use of flexible hydrological model structures for hypothesis testing requires an objective and diagnostic method to identify whether a rainfall-runoff model structure is suitable for a certain catchment. To determine if a model structure is realistic, i.e. if it captures the relevant runoff processes, both performance and consistency are important. We define performance as the ability of a model structure to mimic a specific part of the hydrological behaviour in a specific catchment. This can be assessed based on evaluation criteria, such as the goodness of fit of specific hydrological signatures obtained from hydrological data. Consistency is defined as the ability of a model structure to adequately reproduce several hydrological signatures simultaneously while using the same set of parameter values. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a new evaluation Framework for Assessing the Realism of Model structures ({FARM}). The evaluation framework tests for both performance and consistency using a principal component analysis on a range of evaluation criteria, all emphasizing different hydrological behaviour. The utility of this evaluation framework is demonstrated in a case study of two small headwater catchments (Maimai, New Zealand, and Wollefsbach, Luxembourg). Eight different hydrological signatures and eleven model structures have been used for this study. The results suggest that some model structures may reveal the same degree of performance for selected evaluation criteria while showing differences in consistency. The results also show that some model structures have a higher performance and consistency than others. The principal component analysis in combination with several hydrological signatures is shown to be useful to visualise the performance and consistency of a model structure for the study catchments. With this framework performance and consistency are evaluated to identify which model structure suits a catchment better compared to other model structures. Until now the framework has only been based on a qualitative analysis and not yet on a quantitative analysis.},

A limno-reservoir is a water management infrastructure designed to counteract some negative impacts caused by large reservoirs under Mediterranean climate. Highly detailed inputs were selected to set up the model. Its performance was evaluated by graphical and statistical techniques and compared with the previous knowledge of the basin. An overall good performance was obtained during the calibration and validation periods (monthly and annual {NSE} values of 0.67 and 0.60, respectively, for calibration and 0.70 and 0.83, respectively, for validation). Total discharge was well simulated, and flow components prediction was acceptable. However, the model is not accurate at predicting evapotranspiration. Once evaluated, the model was used to simulate the water discharge into the Pareja Limno-reservoir during 2008 and 2009, establishing a water balance and assessing its hydrologic feasibility. The water balance predicted the absence of surplus during summer (2008 and 2009) and autumn (2009), matching up with the decrease of water level and demonstrating the usefulness of {SWAT} as a tool to evaluate the hydrologic feasibility of the Pareja Limno-reservoir. Very low discharges from the Ompólveda River after a sequence of normal and dry years are the main factors responsible of this phenomenon, whereas the effect of the wastewater flow redirection in the Pareja village is negligible. These results question the usefulness of the Pareja Limno-reservoir during summer, the most favorable season for recreational activities.},

	abstract = {Land use/land cover ({LULC}) and climate changes are important drivers of change in streamflow. Assessing the impact of {LULC} and climate changes on streamflow is typically done with a calibrated and validated watershed model. However, there is a debate on the degree of calibration required. The objective of this study was to quantify the variation in estimated relative and absolute changes in streamflow associated with {LULC} and climate changes with different calibration approaches. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) was applied in an uncalibrated ({UC}), single outlet calibrated ({OC}), and spatially-calibrated ({SC}) mode to compare the relative and absolute changes in streamflow at 14 gaging stations within the Santa Cruz River Watershed in southern Arizona, {USA}. For this purpose, the effect of 3 {LULC}, 3 precipitation (P), and 3 temperature (T) scenarios were tested individually. For the validation period, Percent Bias ({PBIAS}) values were {\textgreater}100\% with the {UC} model for all gages, the values were between 0\% and 100\% with the {OC} model and within 20\% with the {SC} model. Changes in streamflow predicted with the {UC} and {OC} models were compared with those of the {SC} model. This approach implicitly assumes that the {SC} model is “ideal”. Results indicated that the magnitude of both absolute and relative changes in streamflow due to {LULC} predicted with the {UC} and {OC} results were different than those of the {SC} model. The magnitude of absolute changes predicted with the {UC} and {SC} models due to climate change (both P and T) were also significantly different, but were not different for {OC} and {SC} models. Results clearly indicated that relative changes due to climate change predicted with the {UC} and {OC} were not significantly different than that predicted with the {SC} models. This result suggests that it is important to calibrate the model spatially to analyze the effect of {LULC} change but not as important for analyzing the relative change in streamflow due to climate change. This study also indicated that model calibration in not necessary to determine the direction of change in streamflow due to {LULC} and climate change.},

The study area is the Zêzere river basin upstream of Manteigas village located at the Serra da Estrela Mountain in Central Portugal. It provides the source of strategic water resources for the Portuguese mainland, including normal groundwaters, thermomineral waters and surface waters. An integrated approach has been used to formulate a conceptual model for this complex mountain hydrogeological system by integrating the geological, morphotectonic, hydroclimatic, unsaturated soil zone, hydrogeological, hydrogeophysical, hydrogeochemical and isotopic data. This model has been useful to: i) evaluate the water resources; ii) provide the basis for a sustainable management of water resources, iii) design measures for groundwater exploitation and contamination control; and iv) set up land-use policies.},

Guidance to assist users with those two choices is still insufficient. We aim at filling this gap. Firstly, we define criteria to quantify the convergence of sensitivity indices, of ranking and of screening, based on a bootstrap approach. Secondly, we investigate the screening threshold with a quantitative validation procedure for screening results. We apply the proposed methodologies to three hydrological models with varying complexity utilizing three widely-used {GSA} methods ({RSA}, Morris, Sobol’). We demonstrate that convergence of screening and ranking can be reached before sensitivity estimates stabilize. Convergence dynamics appear to be case-dependent, which suggests that “fit-for-all” rules for sample sizes should not be used. Other modellers can easily adopt our criteria and procedures for a wide range of {GSA} methods and cases.},

However, methods that consider the entire Probability Density Function ({PDF}) of the model output, rather than its variance only, are preferable in cases where variance is not an adequate proxy of uncertainty, e.g. when the output distribution is highly-skewed or when it is multi-modal. Still, the adoption of density-based methods has been limited so far, possibly because they are relatively more difficult to implement. Here we present a novel {GSA} method, called {PAWN}, to efficiently compute density-based sensitivity indices. The key idea is to characterise output distributions by their Cumulative Distribution Functions ({CDF}), which are easier to derive than {PDFs}. We discuss and demonstrate the advantages of {PAWN} through applications to numerical and environmental modelling examples. We expect {PAWN} to increase the application of density-based approaches and to be a complementary approach to variance-based {GSA}.},

Sensitivity Analysis ({SA}) provides an essential means for understanding the role and importance of these factors in producing model responses. However, conventional approaches to {SA} suffer from (1) an ambiguous characterization of sensitivity, and (2) poor computational efficiency, particularly as the problem dimension grows. Here, we present a new and general sensitivity analysis framework (called {VARS}), based on an analogy to “variogram analysis,” that provides an intuitive and comprehensive characterization of sensitivity across the full spectrum of scales in the factor space. We prove, theoretically, that Morris (derivative-based) and Sobol (variance-based) methods and their extensions are special cases of {VARS}, and that their {SA} indices can be computed as by-products of the {VARS} framework. Synthetic functions that resemble actual model response surfaces are used to illustrate the concepts, and show {VARS} to be as much as two orders of magnitude more computationally efficient than the state-of-the-art Sobol approach. In a companion paper, we propose a practical implementation strategy, and demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability (robustness) of the {VARS} framework on real-data case studies.},

Motivation for this article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

	abstract = {A method has been developed to investigate the sensitivity of the solutions of large sets of coupled nonlinear rate equations to uncertainties in the rate coefficients. This method is based on varying all the rate coefficients simultaneously through the introduction of a parameter in such a way that the output concentrations become periodic functions of this parameter at any given time t. The concentrations of the chemical species are then Fourier analyzed at time t. We show via an application of Weyl's ergodic theorem that a subset of the Fourier coefficients is related to 〈∂ci/∂kl〉, the rate of change of the concentration of species i with respect to the rate constant for reaction l averaged over the uncertainties of all the other rate coefficients. Thus a large Fourier coefficient corresponds to a large sensitivity, and a small Fourier coefficient corresponds to a small sensitivity. The amount of numerical integration required to calculate these Fourier coefficients is considerably less than that required in tests of sensitivity where one varies one rate coefficient at a time, while holding all others fixed. The Fourier method developed in this paper is not limited to chemical rate equations, but can be applied to the study of the sensitivity of any large system of coupled, nonlinear differential equations with respect to the uncertainties in the modeling parameters.},

	abstract = {Accurate analysis of water flow pathways from rainfall to streams is critical for simulating water use, climate change impact, and contaminants transport. In this study, we developed a new scheme to simultaneously calibrate surface flow ({SF}) and baseflow ({BF}) simulations of soil and water assessment tool ({SWAT}) by combing evolutionary multi-objective optimization ({EMO}) and {BF} separation techniques. The application of this scheme demonstrated pronounced trade-off of {SWAT}'s performance on {SF} and {BF} simulations. The simulated major water fluxes and storages variables (e.g. soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and groundwater) using the multiple parameters from {EMO} span wide ranges. Uncertainty analysis was conducted by Bayesian model averaging of the Pareto optimal solutions. The 90\% confidence interval ({CI}) estimated using all streamflows substantially overestimate the uncertainty of low flows on {BF} days while underestimating the uncertainty of high flows on {SF} days. Despite using statistical criteria calculated based on streamflow for model selection, it is important to conduct diagnostic analysis of the agreement of {SWAT} behaviour and actual watershed dynamics. The new calibration technique can serve as a useful tool to explore the trade-off between {SF} and {BF} simulations and provide candidates for further diagnostic assessment and model identification.

	abstract = {Two approaches can be distinguished in studies of climate change impacts on water resources when accounting for issues related to impact model performance: (1) using a multi-model ensemble disregarding model performance, and (2) using models after their evaluation and considering model performance. We discuss the implications of both approaches in terms of credibility of simulated hydrological indicators for climate change adaptation. For that, we discuss and confirm the hypothesis that a good performance of hydrological models in the historical period increases confidence in projected impacts under climate change, and decreases uncertainty of projections related to hydrological models. Based on this, we find the second approach more trustworthy and recommend using it for impact assessment, especially if results are intended to support adaptation strategies. Guidelines for evaluation of global- and basin-scale models in the historical period, as well as criteria for model rejection from an ensemble as an outlier, are also suggested.},

	abstract = {The Soil and Water Assessment Tool ({SWAT}) is a basin-scale hydrologic model developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service. {SWAT}'s broad applicability, user-friendly model interfaces, and automatic calibration software have led to a rapid increase in the number of new users. These advancements also allow less experienced users to conduct {SWAT} modeling applications. In particular, the use of automated calibration software may produce simulated values that appear appropriate because they adequately mimic measured data used in calibration and validation. Autocalibrated model applications (and often those of unexperienced modelers) may contain input data errors and inappropriate parameter adjustments not readily identified by users or the autocalibration software. The objective of this research was to develop a program to assist users in the identification of potential model application problems. The resulting “{SWAT} Check” is a stand-alone Microsoft Windows program that (i) reads selected {SWAT} output and alerts users of values outside the typical range; (ii) creates process-based figures for visualization of the appropriateness of output values, including important outputs that are commonly ignored; and (iii) detects and alerts users of common model application errors. By alerting users to potential model application problems, this software should assist the {SWAT} community in developing more reliable modeling applications.},

A new simulation model for N dynamics, {DRAINMOD}-N {II}, has been previously evaluated for only a few sites. We evaluated the model using ten years (1996-2005) of measured data from a subsurface-drained, corn-soybean agricultural system near Story City, Iowa. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied to plots at low, medium, and high rates (57 to 67 kg N ha-1, 114 to 135 kg N ha-1, and 172 to 202 kg N ha-1, respectively) during corn years, and nitrate ({NO}3) losses from subsurface drains under each plot were monitored biweekly for ten years. Average annual simulated and measured {NO}3 losses in drainage water were 21.9 and 20.1 kg N ha-1 for the low N rate, 26.6 and 26.5 kg N ha-1 for the medium N rate, and 36.6 and 37.0 kg N ha-1 for the high N rate, respectively. The model efficiency statistics for {DRAINMOD}-N {II} simulations of annual subsurface drain {NO}3 losses were 0.89, 0.95, and 0.94 for the low, medium, and high N rates, respectively. For the same experimental dataset, a comparison of {DRAINMOD}-N {II} simulations to that of another model that simulates hydrologic and N dynamics of agricultural systems, the {RZWQM}-{DSSAT} hybrid model, demonstrated that the two models were most different in their simulations of soybean N fixation, plant N uptake, and net N mineralization. Future field investigations should focus on generating better understandings of these processes. The results suggest that {DRAINMOD}-N {II} can reasonably simulate the effects of different corn-year N rates on losses of {NO}3 through subsurface drainage lines and that simulations of subsurface drainage {NO}3 losses by {DRAINMOD}-N {II} are comparable to that of {RZWQM}-{DSSAT}.},

	abstract = {A distributed model was used to simulate the main hydrological processes in the Ourthe catchment, situated in the southern hilly part of Belgium. The study revealed important uncertainties associated with the current modelling, particularly with regard to the data of the groundwater system. These are likely to influence the global performance of the numerical model and as such a joint deterministic-stochastic protocol based on Monte Carlo simulations was used to calibrate the model and to assess its current prediction limits. Despite the lack of appropriate time series of observations of the groundwater system, the model performance was assessed not only on the overall simulation of streamflow but also on the prediction of hydrograph subflows for which a digital recursive filter was developed and used. The subflow estimates revealed the importance of the groundwater system as a main contributor to the streamflow. Correspondingly, the deterministic–stochastic analysis showed that the sensitivity of predictions to the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity of the modelled groundwater system is highest. In general, broad prediction limits were obtained. The model had some difficulties to mimic well the low flows as well as flows above 60m3s−1. These are believed to be the consequence of the significant data uncertainties and errors in boundary conditions, among other aspects. Nevertheless, the study revealed that considering the subflow estimates for evaluating model performance constitutes a tougher evaluation condition offering the potential of enhancing specificity in the assessment of the model prediction limits.},

However, confidence in the simulation tool’s ability to accurately represent and capture the inherent variability of a watershed is dependent upon high quality input data and subsequent calibration. A four-stage iterative and rigorous calibration procedure is outlined and demonstrated for Soil Water Analysis Tool ({SWAT}) using data from Upper Big Walnut Creek ({UBWC}) watershed in central Ohio, {USA}. The four stages and the sequence of their application were: (1) parameter selection, (2) hydrology calibration, (3) crop yield calibration, and (4) nutrient loading calibration. Following the calibration, validation was completed on a 10 year period. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for streamflow over the validation period were 0.5 for daily, 0.86 for monthly, and 0.87 for annual. Prediction efficiencies for crop yields during the validation period were 0.69 for corn, 0.54 for soybeans, and 0.61 for wheat. Nitrogen loading prediction efficiency was 0.66. Compared to traditional calibration approaches (no crop yield calibration), the four-stage approach (with crop yield calibration) produced improved prediction efficiencies, especially for nutrient balances.},

The {SWAT} model for the Minija River basin was setup by using the developed Matlab ({SWAT}-{LAB}) scripts for a highly customized watershed configuration that addresses the specific needs of the project objective. We performed the watershed delineation by combining sub-basin and hillslope discretization schemes. We defined the {HRUs} by aggregating the topographic, land use, soil, and administrative unit features of the area. A multisite manual calibration approach was adopted to calibrate and validate the model, achieving good to satisfactory results across different sub-basins of the area for flow, sediments and nutrient loads ({TP} and {TN}). After completing the climate change scenario calculations, we found that a net decrease of flow (up to 35\%), {TN} (up to 34\%), and {TP} (up to 50\%) loads are projected under both scenarios. Furthermore, we explored the changes in the streamflow composition and provide new insight on the reason of projected nutrient load decrease.},
